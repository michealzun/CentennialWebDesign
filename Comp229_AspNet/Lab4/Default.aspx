    <h2>Welcome To The Canadian Premier League</h2>
  <p>
      <a href="http://canpl.ca/about/">(text taken from here)</a>Football. Futbol. Soccer. It’s THE global game.
<br/><br/>
FIFA represents more countries than the United Nations.
<br/><br/>
For more than 100 years soccer traditions have spanned the four corners of the earth.
<br/><br/>
Our place, Canada’s place, in the global game has been a story of possibilities.
<br/><br/>
Although we have only qualified for the FIFA World Cup on one occasion, the player pool in Canada continues to develop with an optimistic outlook.
<br/><br/>
However, to date a professional domestic league which would serve as a clear pathway for young players to develop toward and excel beyond is something we currently do not have..
<br/><br/>
International success in the women’s game is even more impetus for us to build on this momentum.  Canada have brought home medals from the past two Olympic Games and made it to the quarter-finals at the most recent FIFA Women’s World Cup.
<br/><br/>
Canada has also developed a strong track record for excelling at hosting record-setting FIFA events including the FIFA U-20 Men’s World Cup Canada 2007 and the FIFA Women’s World Cup Canada 2015.
<br/><br/>
And Canadians love soccer. Over 1 million people from coast to coast are involved in the game annually, including over 820,000 registered players.
<br/><br/>
Canadians also have a solid reputation of supporting the top tier of the game for both club and National team play.
  </p>
    <br/><hr />
<h2>The League</h2>
  <p>
      England has the Premier League. Germany, Bundes Liga. In Spain, it’s simply “La Liga”.
<br/><br/>
In the United States and select Canadian cities, it’s Major League Soccer, yes, that’s America’s domestic league.
<br/><br/>
Introducing the Canadian Premier League, Canada’s very own national soccer league, and Canada’s only professional coast to coast league.
<br/><br/>
Playing in world-class venues, the CPL will bring professional soccer to communities across our great country.
<br/><br/>
Launching in 2018, clubs will vie to capture the Canadian Championship.
<br/><br/>
The Canadian Championship winner then moves on to compete in the CONCACAF Champions’ League with winners from the region, with the ultimate prize of reaching the annual FIFA Club World Cup.
<br/><br/>
While success on the world stage is the ultimate goal, the CPL is also a boon for the entire soccer ecosystem in our country.
<br/><br/>
More Canadians will now have a clearer pathway to playing professionally, and we’ll also cultivate a new generation of officials, coaches, referees and business under the halo of Canadian soccer.
<br/><br/>
The CPL is the way forward for Canadian soccer fans and Canadian players but what impact will it have on our Men’s National Team?
<br/><br/>
The key measure of success for the CPL will be the positive effect on our Men’s National Team program.
<br/><br/>
With hundreds of new opportunities for young Canadian players, there will be a dramatic increase in the player pool, with the knock on effect of creating competition for roster spots that had previously not existed.
<br/><br/>
Canada’s ultimate goal is a spot in the FIFA World Cup and for the players it is the pinnacle of their soccer careers to wear the maple leaf in the world’s biggest sporting competition.
<br/><br/>
And, with the potential for Canada to be one of the hosts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup along with the USA and Mexico, the future has never looked brighter.

    <h2>The Fans</h2>
  <p>
      Authentic soccer means authentic fans.
<br/><br/>
Our supporters will define the experience at the match, where we’ll provide an environment for them to express their unique signatures for supporting their club.
<br/><br/>
From songs and chants, to large orchestrated displays, CPL fans are part of the game.
<br/><br/>
Authentic passion and emotion will be unleashed from within our fans, and will create a unique raw connection that will stand out.
<br/><br/>
WE’RE READY. LET’S GO.
